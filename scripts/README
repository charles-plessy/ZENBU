most of these scripts are legacy code and obsolete. 
I have left these here for historical purposes and for people who might find some of this code interesting.

The only scripts which are still useful are

eedb_chromChunkTool.pl
  used by ZENBU server administrators for loading new genomes into mysql databases 

eedb_sync_entrezgene.pl
  used for loading/updating Entrez genes into mysql database via the NCBI webservices
